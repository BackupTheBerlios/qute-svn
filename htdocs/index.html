      <h1>Qute Utility for Tracking Errors</h1>

      <p>The goal of <span class="qute">Qute</span> is to provide APIs
      and tools to allow user-customized interaction with legacy web
      services, for example a command-line tool to access Bugzilla or a
      Vim interface to a Wiki.</p>

      <p>The most interesting thing we've got so far is our <a
      href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/qute">source</a>
      repository.</p>

      <h2>Current Status</h2>

      <p><span class="qute">Qute</span> is currently made up of two
      Ruby libraries.  <tt>qute.rb</tt> provides an API for
      interacting with web services, making it easy to write programs
      that fill out and submit forms, collect information from HTML
      tables, and follow hyperlinks.  <tt>qutecmd.rb</tt> adds
      features useful for command-line tools, such as formatting ASCII
      result tables and filling out web forms at a command prompt.
      <span class="qute">Qute</span> was developed in-house at <a
        href="http://opensource.hp.com/">HP</a>, which has generously
      released it under the <a href="license.html">BSD
        license</a>.</p>

      <p><span class="qute">Qute</span> has proven to be useful and
      robust as the foundation for tools that interact with two very
      different bug tracking web applications.  However, these are
      proprietary, would not be generally useful outside the companies
      where they were developed, and will not be released.  We are
      planning to use the <span class="qute">Qute</span> modules to
      develop front-end tools for bugzilla.</p>

      <p>As of late September 2004, we're working to release and
      document the latest versions of the <span
        class="qute">Qute</span> modules.</p>
